# CareerFoundry-SQL-Queries

This repository displays my SQL work for the CareerFoundry Data Analyst course.  The SQL portion of the course looked at a fictional movie rental company called Rockbuster.

The task was to load all of Rockbusterâ€™s data into a relational database management system and then use SQL to analyze the data and answer the following key questions:

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based i n?
- Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

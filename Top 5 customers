##Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers

SELECT total_amount_paid.customer_id,
total_amount_paid.first_name,
total_amount_paid.last_name,
AVG(total_amount_paid.total_paid) AS average
FROM
(SELECT B.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
E.country,
D.city,
SUM(A.amount) AS total_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_ID = D.city_ID
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID
WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora','Tokat','Tarsus','Atlixco','Emeishan','Pontianak','Shimoga','Aparecida de Goinia','Zalantun','Taguig')
GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city
ORDER BY total_paid DESC LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid
GROUP BY total_amount_paid.customer_id, total_amount_paid.first_name, total_amount_paid.last_name
Step 2: Find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country.
SELECT D.country,
COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_5_customer_count
FROM customer
